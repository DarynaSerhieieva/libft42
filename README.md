# libft 42
Welcome to the My C Standard Function Library! This library reproduces the behavior of several standard C functions. The library is designed to be easy to use and provides a custom test script to verify the functionality of the implemented functions.

# Testing
To test the functionality of the library, a custom test script is provided. You can run the tests using the following command in the terminal:

```sh
./test_bash.sh
```
This script will execute a series of basic tests to ensure that all functions behave as expected. Note that the tests are very easy and only check several examples for each function, providing a quick way to validate the implementation.
