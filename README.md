Reproducing Behavior of Standard C Functions
In this project, I aim to reproduce the behavior of several standard C library functions.
# Testing
To test the functionality of the library, a custom test script is provided. You can run the tests using the following command in the terminal:

sh
Copy code
./test_bash.sh
This script will execute a series of basic tests to ensure that all functions behave as expected. Note that the tests are very easy and only check several examples for each function, providing a quick way to validate the implementation.
